# MIDS-DATASCI-205-Data-Engineering

Projects for the UC Berkeley MIDS DATASCI 205: Data Engineering course.

This course focused on core data engineering workflows using SQL, Python, Docker, and cloud-based infrastructure. Below are three key projects that highlight practical skills across database querying, ETL pipelines, and graph-based analytics.

---

## Project 1: SQL Queries for Sales Data  
Designed and executed SQL queries to analyze structured sales data hosted in a PostgreSQL database. This project included data modeling via entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), data visualization, and generating model-driven insights, all within a Docker-based AWS cloud environment.

## Project 2: ETL with Data Wrangling and Data Cleansing  
Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline to ingest, validate, and clean third-party sales data. This involved parsing nested JSONs, staging and cleansing raw data using SQL and Python (Pandas), and creating analytics-ready datasets, all within a cloud-hosted VM using Docker containers.

## Project 3: Using Graph Algorithms to Analyze S&P 500 Correlation Networks  
This project explores how graph database techniques and algorithms (e.g., community detection, centrality) can be used to analyze relationships between S&P 500 stocks. Emphasis is placed on business applications where relational databases are insufficient, and tools like Neo4j, MongoDB, and Redis are leveraged for graph analyses, flexible data representation, and real-time access.
